# LearnQuest - A Full Stack Learning Management System

LearnQuest is a full stack learning management system designed to make learning more fun and interacitve. A lot of learning management platforms are very dull such as Canvas which can make learning feel like a chore rather than exciting. Our application improves the learning experience through adding features such as progress bars, mini challenges, and a peer review functionality in order to help students stay motivated while providing them with the tools they need to succeed.
